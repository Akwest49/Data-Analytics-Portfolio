# Data-Analytics-Portfolio
This is a portfolio to show off my skills as a data analyst. Includes SQL and Python.

**SQL**

I wrote and ran the code in the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (21.6.17)

In order to run the SQL code you will need to:
1. Download 3 CSV files. 2 of them are listed here and the third can be downloaded from:
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QPj582YPi00Sp0MuM9nwt6YZrm0EUXYo/view?usp=drive_link
2. Create a new database titled "Portfolio"
3. All 3 files must be imported as flat files into SQL
4. The names of each table are:

Crime_Data_Raw = "Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv"

Crime_Codes = "Crime_Codes.csv"

MO_Codes = "MO_Codes.csv"

First run the file titled "Renaming_Columns.sql" - This was a bit of data cleanup
Then you can ran any and all parts of the "CrimeStats.sql". There are instructions inside for what each piece does.

**Python**
